My problem was that I could not boot Windows, and I needed a way to access my files on a Bitlocked partition. In order to do this, you need a bitlocker recovery password (8 groups of digits) and the ability to boot your system from USB.

    Download and install LiLi on an other Windows machine (Linux Live USB Creator)
    Start LiLi and have it download a lightweight ubuntu image. I chose Xubuntu.
    Install the image to your USB stick.
    Boot the problematic machine with the USB stick
    When you see the ubuntu boot screen, press a key.
    Under F6, set the following options: nomodeset, acpi=off, noacpi and nolacpi
    Boot ubuntu.
    Make a folder /media/windows and /media/mount.
    Download and extract dislocker (http://www.hsc.fr/ressources/outils/dislocker/download/dislocker-0.7.1.tar.gz)
    sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev libpolarssl-dev
    change directory to the dislocker/src folder
    sudo make
    sudo make install
    change directory to /usr/bin
    sudo fdisk -l
    identify the partition which is bitlocked. Mine was /dev/sda1.
    sudo dislocker -r -V /dev/sda1 -p315442-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000 -- /media/windows (replace your own bitlocker key and source partition)
    change dir to /media/windows (use sudo -i if you can't access it)
    mount -o loop dislocker-file /media/mount
    You should now see your files in a mounted drive of the file manager.

Backups are fairly slow, but it might save some trouble if you do end up reinstalling windows. Good luck!
